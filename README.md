# RaspberryPi-Zero-BareMetal

This example of bare metal programming for the Raspberry Pi Zero.  In this case I am using a Pi Zero W.  The ultimate goal is to develop a set of utilities that could be used in a drone system or for model rocketry or whatever you find interesting.  I started out by perusing David Welch's bare metal examples (https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi-zero).
